      - "9090:9090"
    environment:
      - HOST=smtp.host.com
      - MAIL_PORT=587
      - MAIL_USER=youremailaccount
      - MAIL_PASS=youremailpassword

## ENV VARIABLES
* `HOST` **= smtp.host.com** *#your smtp domain address: default is smtp.gmail.com*
* `MAIL_PORT` **= 587** *#your smtp port: default is 587*
* `MAIL_USER` **= youremailaccount** *#your email account name including domain*
* `MAIL_PASS` **= youremailpassword** *#your email account password*
* `FROM_ADDRESS` **= your@email.address** *#your from email address: myemail@domain.com*
* `REALNAME` **= your name** *#your name that appears in from email*
* `MAIL_DEBUG` **= false** *#debug mailing: default false*
* `SECURE_CONNECTION` **= true** *#if ssl is required: default is true*

## USAGE

* When container starts you will see `listening on port 9090` in docker logs
* To send text messages, run the following command `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9090/text --data-urlencode number='18001337' --data-urlencode carrier='att' --data-urlencode 'message=Hello world'`
* To text Canada or International numbers (based on supported carriers listed below), replace `/text` with `/canada` or `/intl`.
* If you do not include carrier in your POST, the app will cycle through all available carriers based on your endpoint (e.g. /text will cycle through all US carriers). If you are using gmail or a similar public email app you will receive a failure response due your high SMTP frequency. You'll also likely receive a bunch of bounceback messages to your email inbox. Despite receiving a failure, the message will likely still go through.
* Successful messages will return a success response.
* Messages that fail to send will return a failure. Unfortunately, the failure reasons are not very descriptive. It is probably your mail settings. If you are using gmail and have two-factor authentication turned on you will need to create an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).
* Received messages will display to the intended recipient based on how each carrier supports email-to-SMS.
